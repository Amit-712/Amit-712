In this analysis, we performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Black Friday dataset to uncover insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The main steps and findings include:

Data Cleaning:

Removed irrelevant or less useful columns (Product_Category_2, Product_Category_3).
Gender Analysis:

Visualized gender distribution among customers using pie and bar charts.
Analyzed total and average purchases by gender.
Age Analysis:

Examined the age distribution of customers.
Analyzed the number of unique products purchased and the total spending by different age groups.
Visualized age distribution with respect to gender and city category.
City Category Analysis:

Investigated customer distribution across different city categories.
Analyzed purchase behavior based on city categories and marital status.
Visualization:

Used various plots such as bar charts, pie charts, and count plots to visualize the data and uncover patterns.
The EDA provided valuable insights into the demographics and purchasing patterns of Black Friday shoppers, which can be used to inform marketing strategies and inventory management for future sales events.
